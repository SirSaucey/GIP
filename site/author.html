            <iframe class="map" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d347274.3279559038!2d27.578849365526825!3d47.15593904332009!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x40cafb7cf639ddbb%3A0x7ccb80da5426f53c!2zSWHImWksIFJvbWFuaWE!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sbe!4v1684669789001!5m2!1sen!2sbe" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
            <p>
                Allow me to share a glimpse into my life's journey. 
                Born on the 4th of December 2004 in the vibrant city of Iasi, Romania, I entered the world with a curious spirit and an eagerness to explore. 
                At the age of six, I embarked on my educational journey, immersing myself in the realms of knowledge and discovery. 
                Alongside my studies, I discovered a passion for handball, dedicating eight years of my life to this exhilarating sport. 
                I even had the privilege of attending a sports school where I honed my skills and experienced the thrill of competing.
                <br><br>However, life took an unexpected turn when my parents made the decision to relocate to Belgium when I was 13. 
                The sudden change and the challenges that accompanied it brought forth a wave of emotions, including a sense of sadness and depression. 
                Adjusting to a new environment, language, and culture can be overwhelming, and it's understandable to feel a range of emotions during such a transition.
            </p>
            <h1> My hobbies </h1>
            <p>
                Among my varied interests, two hobbies hold a special place in my heart: football and gaming. 
                Football, both as a spectator sport and as a player, has always captivated my attention. 
                Whether I'm cheering for my favorite team or lacing up my boots to join a friendly match, the thrill of the game fills me with excitement and camaraderie. 
                The strategy, athleticism, and sheer passion displayed on the pitch never fail to inspire me.
                When I'm not immersed in the world of football, I find solace and adventure in the realm of gaming. 
                Whether it's exploring vast virtual landscapes, solving intricate puzzles, or engaging in thrilling multiplayer battles, gaming provides a unique form of entertainment and escapism. 
                It allows me to unleash my creativity, test my skills, and connect with friends and fellow gamers around the globe.
            </p>
            <h1> Traveling </h1>
            <p>
                From an early age, I developed a deep love for travel, and the joy of exploring new places has always held a special allure for me. Even as a child, I eagerly looked forward to car rides, as they meant embarking on exciting adventures. At the tender age of four, my grandparents became my trusted travel companions, and together we traversed the beautiful landscapes of Romania, discovering hidden gems and embracing the rich cultural tapestry of our homeland.
                <br><br>As I grew older, my horizons expanded beyond the borders of Romania. At the age of ten, I had the opportunity to venture beyond, exploring neighboring countries such as Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece. These experiences ignited a sense of wanderlust within me, and since moving to Belgium, my list of visited countries has continued to grow. From Austria to Hungary, from Germany to Italy, from Switzerland to San Marino, each destination has offered unique experiences, vibrant cultures, and breathtaking sights.
                <br><br>The thrill of discovering new lands, immersing myself in different traditions, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds has shaped my perspective on the world. Travel has become a transformative journey of self-discovery, broadening my horizons and fostering a deep appreciation for the beauty and diversity of our planet.
                As I continue to explore, I eagerly anticipate adding more countries to my ever-growing list, each new destination offering a chance to create unforgettable memories and expand my understanding of the world we share.

            <h1> Internship </h1>
            <p>
                This year, I had the incredible opportunity to embark on an internship adventure in the charming town of Cesenatico, nestled in the picturesque region of Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The experience was truly enriching, allowing me to immerse myself in the renowned Italian way of life. I discovered the art of la dolce vita, where work is approached with a relaxed yet dedicated attitude.
                <br><br>While my internship may not have directly aligned with my field of informatics, I embraced the chance to explore a different aspect of professional life. Sometimes, unexpected experiences can lead to surprising personal growth and a broader perspective. Regardless of the specific tasks I undertook, I relished the chance to learn, adapt, and collaborate with new colleagues, building valuable skills beyond my primary area of expertise.
                <br><br>Ultimately, what matters most is the journey itself, the exposure to different cultures, and the lessons learned along the way. My time in Cesenatico, although unrelated to informatics, undoubtedly contributed to my overall growth as an individual and enriched my understanding of different work environments. I look forward to carrying these invaluable experiences with me as I continue to navigate my chosen path in the field of informatics.
