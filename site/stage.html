            <h1> Cesenatico, Italy </h1>
            <p>
                I had the incredible opportunity to embark on a two-week internship in the beautiful town of Cesenatico, Italy. 
                It was an enriching experience at ADAC, a renowned company in the industry. 
                <br><br>During my time there, I had the privilege of working alongside a talented team of professionals, immersing myself in the Italian work culture and gaining valuable insights into their business practices. 
                <br>The internship broadened my horizons, deepened my understanding of the industry, and fostered connections that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors. I am grateful for the unforgettable memories and the invaluable lessons learned during my time at ADAC in Cesenatico, Italy.
                <br><br> I was initially nervous about the language barrier and cultural differences, but my colleagues were incredibly welcoming and patient with me as I adjusted. One of the biggest differences I noticed was the work-life balance in Italy. The pace of work was slower and there was a greater emphasis on taking breaks and enjoying lunch with colleagues. It was a refreshing change from the fast-paced work environment I was used to.

            <h1> Evolution </h1>
            <p>
            Initial situation
            <br><br>
            When I started my internship period in Cesenatico, Italy on 13/03/2023, I managed to get to work right away. The first day went smoothly, but subsequent internship days were boring because I had to perform tasks that were not very challenging. I often had to make Excel lists and the last three days I had to take over someone's work, such as printing stickers, pasting, making and pasting posters. This made the work more challenging, but it remained boring and monotonous.
            Because my internship supervisor was away, I did not receive an assessment of my performance. However, I think I performed my tasks satisfactorily. When I started the internship, I hoped that I would achieve my goals, but in retrospect, achieving them was little challenging and not very satisfying. Both my mentor and I feel that I did achieve my goals, but it was not a challenging experience because of the boring tasks I had to perform 
            <br><br>
            Evolution
            In terms of internship activities.
            As I mentioned when describing my initial situation, there was no real evolution. In terms of technology, I progressed very quickly because I did not have to think about stickers and copying and pasting data into an Excel file. This was evident in the stack of 1200 plastic folders with stickers. I spent about 14 hours on this activity during my internship and never learned about this in school.
            In terms of socio-emotional coping and communication
            In terms of dealing with my colleagues, I felt very self-confident because some speak a little English and I can understand little Italian. You could notice that very well because:
            <br><br>
            1.    I could understand them
            <br><br>
            2. we could talk about soccer
            <br><br>
            3.    They could understand me
            <br><br>
            4.    I could understand the tasks that they gave to me
            <br><br>
            I discovered mainly about myself that in this area I did not learn anything new.
            Conclusion and objectives
            <br><br>
            During this internship period, I mainly learned that I grew in the area of communication skills. The main causes that I have reached this level are speaking and understanding Italian. With this knowledge in mind, next time I will pay attention to:
            Building more confidence in communicating with others.
            Improve listening skills in Italian.
            Practice and apply Italian grammar.
            Expand and actively use vocabulary.
            Increase knowledge of Italian culture.
            <br><br>
            Second week
            <br><br>
            My supervisor gave me feedback to work more calmly and relaxed and that was a valuable lesson. This was a valuable lesson and will help me not only work more efficiently, but also deliver better quality work.
            <br><br>During the week, I was given new Excel lists to complete and was able to apply my Python skills to automate these tasks. It was challenging to do this, but I persevered and eventually completed it successfully. This experience taught me that perseverance and problem-solving skills are essential in my job.
            <br><br>On the last day, we did physical work, which was a pleasant change from my daily office job. I spoke more Italian and felt more confident as a result. I also gained more understanding of the tasks I had to do and I am happy with my progress. I can say it was a more productive and satisfying week than the first week.
