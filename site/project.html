            <h1> My Project </h1>
            <p>
                The game is a first-person horror game where the player must explore a haunted house to uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of the previous occupants. The player must solve puzzles, collect items, and avoid supernatural enemies that roam the house.
            </p>
            <h1> Why? </h1>
            <p>
                I had to choose between three ideas for my GIP project and those ideas were: a 3D Horror Game, a 2D Hack and Slash Dungeon Game, and a language App. I chose the 3D Horror Game for my GIP not only because I am fond of the horror genre and quite enjoy it, but also because I like a challenge. The game is currently in development and I have made some nice progress on it, but I still feel that it is not enough and I want to do more to make it even better.
            </p>
            <h1> Game Content </h1>
            <p>
                Prepare to embark on a chilling journey into the unknown as you delve into the DEMO version of my game. The storyline begins with the mysterious car crash of John Rowe on the fateful date of May 29th, 1983. As the player, you awaken next to the wreckage, armed only with a flashlight, and find yourself surrounded by an eerie forest.
                <br><br>Step cautiously as you explore your surroundings, for each step could lead you closer to the truth or deeper into darkness. The forest reveals its secrets through the presence of numerous mannequins, which evoke an unsettling feeling of being watched. As you push forward, your curiosity leads you to uncover a hidden trapdoor concealed within the forest floor.
                <br><br>Descending into the depths of the mine, your heart races with anticipation. A door reveals itself, opening a path to an enigmatic underground house shrouded in mystery. Within its dimly lit rooms lie secrets waiting to be unraveled. However, your quest for answers becomes a race against time as you realize you are not alone. A relentless stalker pursues you through the twisting corridors of a labyrinth, leaving you with a constant sense of dread and urgency.
                <br><br> Remember. This is just the DEMO of the game.
            </p>
            <h1> Conclusion </h1>
            <p>
                My venture into game development has been both enjoyable and enlightening. As a single developer, I gained a deep appreciation for the immense amount of work involved in creating a game. The experience has given me a newfound understanding of why game development is a time-consuming process. Despite the challenges, I found immense satisfaction in the creative journey. I now have a greater passion for further exploring game development and continuing to refine my skills. Overall, it has been a valuable experience that will shape my future endeavors in this captivating field.
